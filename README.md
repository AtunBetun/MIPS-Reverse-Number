# MIPS-Reverse-Number

Write a loop that reverses order of the bits of an 8-bit number in $s0 and stores the result in $s1.


MIPS registers have 4 bytes, but in this problem, the higher 24 bits of $s0 are always 0.


For example, if the lower 8 bits of $s0 are 00001101, the lower 8 bites of $s1 should be 10110000.
